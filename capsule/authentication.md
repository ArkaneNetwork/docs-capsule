# Authentication

## Client ID

To connect to our [staging or production environment](../deep-dive/environments-and-networks.md) and the different networks, a private Client ID is required. By using a Client ID that is linked to your application, an extra level of security is added, as it allows transaction filtering based on origin.

## Basic Authentication flow

A client id comes with a `shared secret` that can be used to retrieve a `Bearer token` which can be used to call the different endpoints. Here is a small diagram explain the authentication flow.
