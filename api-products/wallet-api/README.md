# Wallet API

With the Venly Wallet API, you are able to create blockchain wallets while at the same time offloading the key management and security risks and responsibilities. It is an API solution that allows basic wallet functionalities such as performing a simple token transfer, as well as executing more complex contract calls, while at the same time allowing you to take complete control over the UI and UX.
