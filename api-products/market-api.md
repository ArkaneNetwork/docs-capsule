# Market API

The Arkane Market API offers you a set of endpoints that allows you to build and manage your own NFT marketplace. The Market API supports the most common NFT standards, such as ERC721 and ERC1155, as well as support for multiple blockchains. The endpoints are constructed in a way, that you have **complete freedom** to pick which NFT you want to support in your own market as well as which payment providers you want to integrate.
