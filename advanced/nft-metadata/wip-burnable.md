# Burnable

## Burnable

When creating the NFT template you can add advanced parameters to the JSON configuration, such as defining if an NFT can be burned. Burning an NFT effectively destroys the token and removes it entirely from the blockchain. When you burn an NFT, the transaction is irreversible.

You can define if NFTs from a certain NFT template can be burned by adding the optional field `burnable` to your  NFT template configuration. Default it is set to false.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that `burnable` is configured, stored, and track on-chain, meaning once set it can not be altered.
{% endhint %}
